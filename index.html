          At Service Zen we are combining over 20 years experience in Service Management in several ecosystems
          (ServiceNow, Salesforce, Oracle, Workday, etc.) and several industries (Banking, Insurance, Software, Government),
          with the incredible technology that is process mining, redefining Business Process Management by taking an X-ray
          of your company to see and improve your 'living business processes' in real time.

        <h2>About</h2> 
        <p> 
          Service Zen is a proud, 100% Canadian owned company, with its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario.
          The Service Zen name combines two themes important to us, a focus on business value and services, 
          and the state an organization can achieve when business and technology are aligned.

      <h2>Zen X-Ray</h2> 
      <p> 
        Zen X-Ray is our methodology to model, analyze, and optimize your business processes. 
        Think of an X-ray, or MRI, of your company that shows how your processes actually run â€” not how you think they run.
